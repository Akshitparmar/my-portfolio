        I am Akshit Parmar, and my academic journey reflects a commitment to excellence. I achieved outstanding results in both high school and intermediate studies under the CBSE board. Currently, I am enrolled in the B-Tech program for Computer Science and Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology.

In terms of soft skills, I bring optimism, intelligence, and a positive mindset to any endeavor. I am recognized for being hardworking, an attribute that fuels my dedication to academic and professional pursuits. These qualities, combined with my technical skills encompassing C++, problem-solving, Python, DBMS, and OOP, position me as a well-rounded candidate in the field of computer science.

My strengths lie in self-confidence, adaptability, and effective teamwork. I am well-organized, efficient, and systematic, contributing to my ability to navigate various situations. However, I am actively addressing a tendency to overly self-criticize by redirecting my focus towards acknowledging my achievements. To counter this, I practice cultivating three positive thoughts for every negative one, fostering a more balanced and constructive mindset.

In the short term, I aim to secure a position in a reputed company. I bring with me not only technical skills but also the ability to work collaboratively and manage time efficiently. Looking ahead, my long-term goal is to attain a prominent position where I can contribute to both personal career growth and organizational success.

I pride myself on being flexible and adaptive, readily embracing opportunities to learn new skills and stay abreast of industry developments. This adaptability is a crucial asset in the ever-evolving field of computer science.

In conclusion, my academic achievements, technical proficiency, and dedication to personal growth reflect my commitment to success. I am eager to contribute my skills and continue learning as I progress through my B-Tech program and embark on a fulfilling career.
