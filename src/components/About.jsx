        I am pursuing B-Tech in computer science and engineering from Srm institute of science and techonology.
        My hobbies are playing some outdoor games like cricket for physical fitness, listening to music and watching crime and investigation series.
        My strength is hard-working, self-confidence, adaptable in any kind of situation and team work.
        My weakness is I am uncomfortable until I finished my work in the given time i.e i can not enjoy moments till my work is not completed .
        My short-term goal is to get a job in a reputed company.

        I know how to work in a team or how to manange time and i know how to work together to achieve a common goal .
